--username
Username for login

--password
Password for login

--url
URL for desired shoe

--shoe-size
Self-explanatory (NOTE: this fails if both women and men sizes are available)

--login-time
If given, the bot will pause until a specific time before it logs in (can be any datetime format)

--release-time
If given, the bot will pause until a specific time before it purchase the sneaker (can be any datetime format)

--screenshot-path
If given, the bot will take a screenshot of the page after purchasing and save it at the given file path (may be useful for debugging)

--html-path
If given, the bot will take the page source after purchasing and save it at the given file path (may be useful for debugging)

--page-load-timeout
This is used to limit the page load time (in seconds), which can be useful when the page is still loading, but the UI is nevertheless useable. This is pretty much a necessity as I've noticed Nike's pages hang all the time. I'd recommend using 1-3 seconds for this.

--driver-type
Should be 'firefox' or 'chrome' (the OS will be determined for you)

--headless
This will run the driver in headless mode, which should make the bot quicker

--select-payment
If you already have your payment options pre-saved on your Nike account, DO NOT use this. If for some reason you don't have it pre-saved (even though it will cost the bot more time) the bot will select the first payment option it finds.
--purchase
If this argument is given, the bot WILL attempt to purchase the shoe so USE WITH CAUTION!

--num-retries
If the bot fails for some reason, it will retry any number of times or until successful
